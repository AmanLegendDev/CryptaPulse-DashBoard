## ✨ What I Built
CryptoPulse isn’t a basic “fetch-and-display” project.  
It’s a **real-time financial dashboard** built on the same principles used by pro web apps:

- ⚡ **Hybrid Rendering** (SSR + CSR)  
- 📊 **Live API updates** with auto-refresh  
- ⭐ **Local Storage Watchlist** (Add/Remove coins)  
- 🎬 **Framer Motion Animations**  
- 🛠️ **Reusable components + clean code structure**  
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS UI with smooth gradients**  

This app doesn't "load pages" — it **flows** like a modern interface.
